## Description

For this challenge we were tasked with creating multiple functions in Javascript to both prompt users for their desired length and character types to be used or not.  As well make a new function using the information from the former to generate a random password meeting their criteria.  This assignment tested our ability to use the bascis of Javascript through features such as: setting up variables, calling those variables within functions, prompting users, using 'if' statements to determine if the users preferences are applicable in our password generation, for loops to run the generation to the desired amount, and call functions to have them actually run. 

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

The application of this homework assignment is incredibly relevant.  Walking through the steps to generate, first of all, an interactable feature nested within a website that allows us to interact with the user, as well create a boolean of randomly generated information; this kind of knowlege is both fascinating and extremly useful for web development.  Lastly, the site itself is fantastic for gathering user data, and can actually be used for password generation!
